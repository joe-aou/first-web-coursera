The project is an authentication system that validates user for accessing the system only when they have input correct password. The project involves three levels of user authentication. There are varieties of password systems available, many of which have failed due to bot attacks while few have sustained it but to a limit.

It contains three logins having three different kinds of password system. The password difficulty increases with each level. Users have to input correct password for successful login. Users would be given privilege to set passwords according to their wish. The project comprises of text password i.e. passphrase, image based password and graphical password for the three levels respectively.
